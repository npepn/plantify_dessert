   - Affects viscosity and prevents ice crystals

3. **Cornstarch (40g)**
   - Function: Primary thickener
   - Replaces: Egg yolk thickening power
   - Properties: Creates smooth, glossy texture
   - Ratio: 6.7% of liquid (optimal for custard)
   - Why chosen: Reliable, neutral flavor, gluten-free
   - Cooking temp: 85-90°C for full activation
   - CO₂ impact: 0.7 kg/kg (very low)

4. **Agar Agar Powder (3g)**
   - Function: Binding, setting agent
   - Replaces: Egg protein coagulation
   - Properties: Sets at room temperature, heat-stable
   - Why chosen: Creates firm set without eggs
   - Ratio: 0.5% of liquid (light set, not jelly-like)

   - Critical: Must be heated to 85°C+ to activate

5. **Pure Vanilla Extract (10ml)**
   - Function: Flavor carrier
   - Essential for classic crème brûlée taste
   - Use real vanilla, not imitation
   - Adds depth and complexity

6. **Fine Sea Salt (1g)**
   - Function: Flavor enhancement
   - Balances sweetness
   - Enhances vanilla notes

**Critical Properties Achieved**:
- Fat content: 18% ✓ (target: 15-25%)
- Protein content: 3.5% ✓ (target: 3-6%)
- Viscosity: 6500 cps ✓ (target: 3000-8000 cps)
- Smooth, creamy texture with proper set

**Food Chemistry Explanation**:

Traditional crème brûlée relies on egg yolks for:
1. Thickening (protein coagulation at 65-70°C)
2. Emulsification (lecithin in yolks)
3. Rich mouthfeel (fat content)
4. Color (yellow pigments)

Our plant-based version achieves this through:
1. **Cornstarch** provides thickening (starch gelatinization)
2. **Agar agar** provides setting (polysaccharide gel formation)
3. **Coconut cream** provides fat and emulsification
4. **Gentle heating** prevents curdling (no protein to denature)

The combination creates a custard that:
- Sets firmly but remains creamy
- Has rich mouthfeel from coconut fat
- Doesn't curdle or separate
- Caramelizes beautifully on top

### Component 2: Caramelized Sugar Top (10% of dessert)

**Required Functions**:
- Crystallization control
- Browning (caramelization)

**Ingredients**:
- Organic Cane Sugar: 60g (10g per serving)

**Why This Ingredient?**

1. **Organic Cane Sugar (60g)**
   - Function: Caramelization, crunchy texture
   - Properties: Melts at 160°C, caramelizes at 170-180°C
   - Why chosen: Clean caramelization, classic flavor
   - Creates signature crackable crust
   - Must be applied just before serving

**Caramelization Science**:
- Sugar melts and breaks down into hundreds of flavor compounds
- Creates golden-brown color and complex flavor
- Rapid cooling creates brittle, glassy texture
- Torch method: 1200°C flame, 30-60 seconds per ramekin

## Complete Recipe Instructions

### Custard Base

1. **Prepare ramekins**: Arrange 6 ramekins (150ml capacity each) in deep baking dish. Set aside.
   - Tip: Use ceramic ramekins for even heat distribution

2. **Preheat oven**: Preheat to 150°C (300°F).
   - *Critical*: Low temperature prevents curdling
   - Tip: Use oven thermometer for accuracy

3. **Mix dry ingredients**: In medium saucepan, whisk together sugar, cornstarch, agar agar, and salt until well combined.
   - Tip: Mix dry first to prevent lumps

4. **Add coconut cream**: Gradually whisk in coconut cream until completely smooth with no lumps.
   - *Critical*: Whisk thoroughly to dissolve agar agar
   - Tip: Use room temperature cream for easier mixing

5. **Heat mixture**: Place saucepan over medium heat. Cook, whisking constantly, until mixture thickens, bubbles, and reaches 85-90°C (8-10 minutes).
   - *Critical*: Must reach 85°C to activate agar agar
   - *Critical*: Constant whisking prevents scorching
   - Mixture will thicken noticeably and coat back of spoon
   - Don't let it boil rapidly

6. **Add vanilla**: Remove from heat. Whisk in vanilla extract until fully incorporated.
   - Tip: Add vanilla off heat to preserve flavor

7. **Strain**: Pour mixture through fine-mesh sieve into measuring cup or bowl with spout.
   - *Critical*: Straining ensures silky smooth texture
   - Removes any lumps or undissolved particles

8. **Fill ramekins**: Divide mixture evenly among 6 ramekins (approximately 100ml each).
   - Tip: Fill to about 1cm from rim
   - Wipe any drips from ramekin edges

9. **Prepare water bath**: Pour hot water into baking dish to reach halfway up sides of ramekins (bain-marie).
   - *Critical*: Water bath ensures gentle, even cooking
   - Prevents cracking and ensures smooth texture
   - Water should be hot but not boiling

10. **Bake**: Carefully transfer to oven. Bake 35-40 minutes until custards are set but still slightly jiggly in center (like jello).
    - *Critical*: Don't overbake - custards firm up as they cool
    - Test: Gently shake ramekin - center should wobble slightly
    - Edges should be completely set

11. **Cool**: Remove ramekins from water bath using tongs. Let cool to room temperature on wire rack (30-45 minutes).
    - Tip: Don't rush cooling - prevents condensation

12. **Chill**: Cover each ramekin with plastic wrap. Refrigerate minimum 4 hours or overnight.
    - *Critical*: Proper chilling essential for texture
    - Custard continues to set during chilling
    - Can be made up to 3 days ahead

### Caramelized Sugar Top

**Important**: Caramelize sugar just before serving for best texture.

1. **Dry surface**: Remove custards from refrigerator. Blot any condensation from surface with paper towel.
   - *Critical*: Dry surface essential for even caramelization
   - Moisture prevents proper caramelization

2. **Apply sugar**: Sprinkle 10g (approximately 1 tablespoon) sugar evenly over each custard.
   - Tip: Use fine granulated sugar for even layer
   - Shake ramekin gently to distribute evenly
   - Sugar layer should be thin and uniform

3. **Caramelize**: Using kitchen torch, hold flame 5-8cm from surface. Move in circular motion until sugar melts and turns deep golden brown (30-60 seconds per ramekin).
   - *Critical*: Keep torch moving to prevent burning
   - Watch for even golden-brown color
   - Some darker spots are okay, but avoid black (burnt)
   - Alternative: Use oven broiler (watch carefully, 2-3 minutes)

4. **Set**: Let caramelized sugar cool and harden for 2-3 minutes.
   - Sugar will be very hot initially
   - Hardens into crispy, crackable crust

5. **Serve**: Serve immediately while sugar is crispy.
   - Tip: Provide small spoons for cracking through crust
   - Contrast of crunchy top and creamy custard is signature
